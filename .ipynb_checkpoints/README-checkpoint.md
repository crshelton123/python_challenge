## My Steps
* I began by initializing string, integer, and list variables and importing the csv file. 
* Next I had to skip the first row as it was the header. 
* I needed to begin the daily change computations on the second row of data, therefore I skipped the first row of data, but captured their values within variables. 
* I then used a for loop to count the rows as months, calculate the daily change and each date, and store them within lists. 
* Then the for loop could also calculate the greatest increase and decrease and each date associated with that and store them in my empty string variables.
* The last step was to print my results to the terminal to check for errors. Everything came out correectly so I created a list of lines and output to a text file and created a new line for each piece of information.
